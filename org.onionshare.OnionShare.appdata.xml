    <p>
      OnionShare is an open source tool for securely and anonymously sending and receiving files using Tor onion
      services. It works by starting a web server directly on your computer and making it accessible as an unguessable
      Tor web address that others can load in Tor Browser to download files from you, or upload files to you. It doesn't
      require setting up a separate server, using a third party file-sharing service, or even logging into an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike services like email, Google Drive, DropBox, WeTransfer, or nearly any other way people typically send files
      to each other, when you use OnionShare you don't give any companies access to the files that you're sharing. So
      long as you share the unguessable web address in a secure way (like pasting it in an encrypted messaging app), no
      one but you and the person you're sharing with can access the files.
